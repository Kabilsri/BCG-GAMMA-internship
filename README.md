# BCG GAMMA Internship - README

## Overview
This repository contains work completed during my internship at BCG GAMMA. The project focuses on applying advanced analytics, machine learning, and data science techniques to solve a business challenge for a client. The key areas of contribution include data preprocessing, model development, evaluation, and business insights.

## Project Structure
- **data/**: Contains raw and processed datasets used for model training and evaluation.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks detailing the data exploration, feature engineering, and model building steps.
- **src/**: Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **reports/**: Key findings, insights, and executive summaries for stakeholders.
- **presentation/**: Final slide decks prepared for the client and internal teams.

## Key Components
- **Problem Statement**: Understanding and defining the clientâ€™s business problem.
- **Data Processing**: Cleaning, transforming, and preparing data for analysis.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implementing and fine-tuning predictive models.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Measuring model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- **Business Impact**: Translating technical findings into actionable business recommendations.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/BCG-GAMMA-Internship.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run Jupyter notebooks for step-by-step analysis:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Execute model training scripts:
   ```sh
   python src/train_model.py
   ```

## Executive Summary
The project identified key insights and actionable recommendations based on machine learning models. The findings were presented to stakeholders in a structured format, following the **Situation-Complication-Question-Answer (SCQA)** framework.

## Technologies Used
- Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git/GitHub
- PowerPoint (for presentation and executive summary)
